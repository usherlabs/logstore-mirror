## ‚≠ê Key Features: Security, Efficiency, and Empowerment in Data Management

Traditional data management systems are often centralized, creating a host of challenges, including security vulnerabilities, data silos, dependence on third parties, and high maintenance costs. Log Store transforms data management through decentralization by addressing these issues head-on:

- **Security & Integrity**: By leveraging cryptographic security and decentralized architecture, Log Store ensures that data is tamper-proof and immutable. The integrity of data is guaranteed through consensus algorithms that verify the information across the network.
- **Efficiency**: High throughput and low latency are crucial in data transactions. Log Store is designed to provide an efficient environment for storing and querying data. Its dynamic pricing model ensures cost optimization, as the users fairly compensate network operators based on the services they utilize.
- **Interoperability & Composability**: Time-series data composability in Log Store facilitates trustless decentralized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, enabling seamless data management across platforms.
- **User Empowerment**: Log Store empowers users by granting them full control over their data. This autonomy eliminates the need for third-party services, enabling users to manage and query data according to their specific needs.
- **Trustlessness & Permissionlessness**: Data transmitted over streams/topics to be stored by the Log Store Network do not require anything more than token management and wallet authentication. Access management is cryptographically determined, and all data stored yields a time-series append-only event log.

## **üîß Architecture and Components**

Log Store employs a multi-layered architecture to achieve decentralized, secure, and efficient custom-data management:

- **Broker Network**: The Broker Network is the first layer, comprising Streamr Broker Nodes integrated with the Log Store Plugin. This layer stores real-time events and facilitates query connections through HTTP. The Broker Network is essential for providing high throughput and low latency, ensuring data is efficiently processed and readily available.
- **Validator Network**: Operating as the second layer, the Validator Network is built on the KYVE Network and is crucial for data integrity and security. This layer consists of nodes coordinating a consensus-based data lake and facilitating decentralized Arweave Blockchain storage. By validating data, the network ensures that the stored information is accurate and has not been tampered with.
- **Data Reporting**: The nodes within the Broker Network read data Reports produced by Validators from the decentralized data lake, then push reports to the Polygon Smart Contract. Log Store takes inspiration from Chainlink‚Äôs Off-Chain Reporting strategy to optimize gas costs and maintain decentralization. This ensures data is not only secure but also efficiently managed.
- **Verifying Custom Data**: Log Store allows for programming checks on data validity. These checks ensure that the data is tamper-proof and immutable. This process may take place within a zero-party environment, further bolstering data integrity and security.

Learn in-depth by reading our üìò [Log Store Network Primer](https://docs.logstore.usher.so/network/overview/primer).

## **üîê AlphaNet: The Foundation**

AlphaNet serves as the foundational release of the Log Store Network. It enables the team behind the Log Store to permission Node Operator access while enabling open access to data publishers and consumers.

- **Compatibility**: AlphaNet is designed to be compatible with Streamr Network‚Äôs pub/sub topics, Polygon Blockchain‚Äôs MainNet, and Arweave‚Äôs storage environment. This compatibility ensures seamless integration and facilitates efficient data management.
- **Acquiring LSAN Tokens**: To participate in AlphaNet, users need to acquire LSAN tokens by depositing MATIC into the Log Store AlphaNet ERC20 Smart Contract. These tokens are essential for transacting within the network. The next section will guide you better through it.
- **Community Involvement**: AlphaNet thrives on community participation. Users are encouraged to engage with the network, share experiences, report bugs, and contribute to its enhancement. This collaborative approach is critical for refining and preparing the network for future releases.

We‚Äôve prepared üöÄ [AlphaNet Overview](https://docs.logstore.usher.so/network/overview/alphanet) to navigate you through our expectations for it.

## **üë©‚Äçüíª Getting Started**

To begin using Log Store, you need to acquire LSAN tokens, stake them, and interact with the network using various tools and interfaces.

### **Minting LSAN Tokens**

LSAN tokens are the fuel for the Log Store network. They are necessary to perform operations such as data storage and querying. Here's how you can mint LSAN tokens:

- **Free & Limited LSAN Tokens:** Head over to the Usher Labs Discord Server and request free LSAN tokens. A limited amount of tokens can be distributed to you on a monthly basis.
- **Mint LSAN Tokens:** LSAN tokens are minted using MATIC tokens. Use Log Store CLI to mint LSAN tokens to secure all the storage and query capacity you require.

  üí∞ **[Minting LSAN Tokens](https://docs.logstore.usher.so/network/cli/mint-lsan)**

Note: The number of LSAN tokens minted is calculated based on storage costs to ensure fair compensation for using the decentralized network.

### **Staking LSAN Tokens**

Staking LSAN tokens to enable data storage and querying services.
