# Overview

AlphaNet is an integral part of the LogStore ecosystem, deployed on the Polygon Blockchain. It serves as a testbed for LogStore's decentralized data storage and retrieval solution, while also remaining compatible with the Streamr Network’s live pub/sub topics (streams), and Arweave’s live storage environment.

### Getting Started with AlphaNet

To interact with AlphaNet, you will need to follow a simple set of instructions. First, you must acquire LSAN tokens — a custom token developed exclusively for the LogStore AlphaNet. These tokens facilitate transactions within the network and can be obtained by depositing MATIC into the LogStore AlphaNet Smart Contract.

### Roadmap to BetaNet & MainNet

AlphaNet is a stepping stone toward the full deployment of the Log Store Network.

As we transition from AlphaNet to BetaNet and eventually to MainNet, the LSAN tokens will play a crucial role. These tokens will eventually be destroyed as part of a hard fork, paving the way for deploying a new set of Smart Contracts powered by a token with production-grade tokenomics.

### Participation and Community Engagement

Your participation is vital to the success and improvement of AlphaNet. We encourage you to use the network, share your experiences, report bugs, and help us make it better. Stay connected with our team and other users through Discord and Twitter channels. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable as we continue developing and improving our services.

By using AlphaNet responsibly and proactively, you contribute to the creation of a robust, efficient, and secure decentralized event/atomic data storage and retrieval ecosystem.
